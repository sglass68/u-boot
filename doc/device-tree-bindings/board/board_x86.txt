x86 board driver
================

This driver allows providing board-specific features such as power control
GPIOs. In addition, the SMBIOS values can be specified in the device tree,
as below:

An optional 'smbios' subnode can be used to provide these properties.

Optional properties::
  - manufactuer:  Product manuafacturer for system / baseboard
  - product:     Product name
  - serial:      Serial number for system (overriden by serial# environment var)


Example::

	board {
		compatible = "google,coral";

		smbios {
			manufacturer = "Google";
			product = "Coral";
			version = "rev2";
			serial = "123456789";
			sku = "sku3";
			family = "Google_Coral";
			asset-tag = "ABC123";
		};
	};
